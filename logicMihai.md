There is a bag with 10kg of weight capacity. (infine volume)

Mihai wants to put the most value in the bag, taking
into account the 10kg capacity of the bag.

There are salamis with different price ranges and different
weights.

Salami A = 100$ && 5kg      200$ && 10kg

Salami B = 70$ && 3kg     3*70(210)$ +23.33 = 233.33$    10kg

Salami C = 50$ && 4kg      125$ && 10kg

Salami D = 25$ && 2kg     125$ && 10kg


    70$ (3kg)
    100$ (5kg)
    25$ (2kg)
