- A computer and a SHOE, share the same level of intelligence 



- The hard part about writing a computer program is not about being as smart as the computer... Is "TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO BE " AS MIND-NUMBILGLY STUPID AS A COMPUTER" 
Once you understand this you'll be able to write programs 

What I wish I'd been taught: 

- Programming is not about languages 
- The language ultimately doesn't matter much
- There's not a lot of memorising
- Most programming isn't about math
- Programming languages are simpler than human languages.
- WHAT PROGRAMMING REALLY IS ABOUT IS SOLVING PROBLEMS 
- It's about explaining things to the idiot computer: Thing about it like this and it will be less frightening.



	Code isn't about language

- Coding has only about eight main concepts.
- They work in almost the same way in every language
- Learn how to use these concepts in English
- Write out the concepts first, then convert to code later

	Comments are Code 

- Comments explain code to other programmers. 
- Code is there to explain the comments to the computer BOOM 

	1. NEW VARIABLE

- Name: What do we call this thing? 
- Type: what type of data does it contain? 
- InitVal: what is its starting value? 

New variable algorithm 

	Your sentence has to answer this questions...

	Create a variable called NAME of type
TYPE that starts with the value INITVAL "initVal".

- What's the name?
- What's the type?
- What's the starting value?

2. OUTPUT code

3. INPUT

- Variable: where answer from user will be stored.
- Message: question being asked of the user. 

How are you gonna give an answer if you have not been asked a question?

	Input algorithm 

	Ask the user MESSAGE and store the answer in a variable 


FAILURE IS WONDERFUL!

- This is a normal part of programming
- Begin debugging now
- Did you tell it what to do incorrectly?
- Or did you tell it to do the wrong thing?
- Students thing is an implementation problem when it's almost always an algorithm problem (an understanding problem)


HOW TO DEBUG

- The best way to debug is not to have bugs for starters.
- Bad implementation can be googled
- Bad algorithms can not be googled 
- What are you not understanding? 
-  What tool can you use to debug?
- Don't start with a solution. To a problem you don't understand. START BY UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM.

WHAT HAPPENED HERE ? 

- Easy to assume + sign is broken 
- That's not really the problem
- Try print("python" + "meetup")

CONVERT TO INTEGE CODE

- convert oldVariable to integer and store in intVariable

	FOR LOOP

- sentry: integer variable that will control loop
- start: integer value of sentry at beginning 
- finish: integer value of sentry at end
- change: integer to add to sentry at each pass 

	WHILE LOOP 

Initialize sentry with initialization code then continue loop as longs as condition is true. Inside loop, change sentry with change code 

Note the syntax only requires a condition.

Good logic requires much more. This is  why while loops can be such notorious problems for beginners.
